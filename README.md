What Is a Database?

  -A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data
  -Modeled in rows and columns.
  -easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized.

What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?

  -programming language to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control
  

What’s the difference between a database and a spreadsheet?

  -How the data is stored and manipulated
  -Who can access the data
  -How much data can be stored

Types of databases

  -Relational databases
    -Items in a relational database are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows
    
  -Object-oriented databases
    -Information in an object-oriented database is represented in the form of objects, as in object-oriented programming.  
    
   -Distributed databases 
    -A distributed database consists of two or more files located in different sites. The database may be stored on multiple computers,
    located in the same physical location, or scattered over different networks.
    
   -Data warehouses
    -Central repository for data
    
   -NoSQL databases
    -unstructured and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated
    
   -Graph Databases
    -A graph database stores data in terms of entities and the relationships between entities.
    
   -Open source databases
    -An open source database system is one whose source code is open source; such databases could be SQL or NoSQL databases.
   
   -cloud database 
   
   -Multimodel database
   
   -Multimodel databases
   
   -Self-driving databases
   
What is database software?

-used to create, edit, and maintain database files and records, enabling easier file and record creation,
data entry, data editing, updating, and reporting

What is a database management system (DBMS)?

-serves as an interface between the database and its end users or programs, allowing users to retrieve, update,
and manage how the information is organized and optimized

What is a MySQL database?

an open source relational database management system based on SQL. It was designed and optimized for web applications and can run on any platform

Database challenges

Absorbing significant increases in data volume. The explosion of data coming in from sensors, connected machines, and dozens of other sources keeps database administrators scrambling to manage and organize their companies’ data efficiently.
Ensuring data security. Data breaches are happening everywhere these days, and hackers are getting more inventive. It’s more important than ever to ensure that data is secure but also easily accessible to users.
Keeping up with demand. In today’s fast-moving business environment, companies need real-time access to their data to support timely decision-making and to take advantage of new opportunities.
Managing and maintaining the database and infrastructure. Database administrators must continually watch the database for problems and perform preventative maintenance, as well as apply software upgrades and patches. As databases become more complex and data volumes grow, companies are faced with the expense of hiring additional talent to monitor and tune their databases.
Removing limits on scalability. A business needs to grow if it’s going to survive, and its data management must grow along with it. But it’s very difficult for database administrators to predict how much capacity the company will need, particularly with on-premises databases.
Ensuring data residency, data sovereignty, or latency requirements.
